# Next Steps - Building the Nx SurrealDB Migration Plugin

## âœ… Completed
- Verified WebSocket SDK compatibility with SurrealDB Cloud v2.3.3
- Tested all migration features (tables, functions, access methods, transactions)
- Confirmed proper function syntax and query patterns

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create the Nx Plugin Structure
```bash
# From workspace root
nx g @nx/plugin:plugin nx-surrealdb-migrations --directory=packages/nx-surrealdb-migrations
```

### Step 2: Core Components to Build

1. **Migration Client** (`lib/client.ts`)
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Authentication handling
   - Query execution wrapper

2. **Migration Runner** (`lib/migration-runner.ts`)
   - Migration table management
   - Execute migrations in order
   - Track execution history
   - Checksum validation

3. **Executors**
   - `migrate` - Run pending migrations
   - `rollback` - Rollback migrations
   - `status` - Show migration status
   - `create` - Generate new migration file

4. **Generators**
   - `migration` - Create new migration file with timestamp

### Step 3: Integration with Your Database Structure
- Read migrations from `database/migrations/`
- Support your naming convention (`0000_name.surql`)
- Handle complex queries (functions, access methods)
- Environment variable substitution

### Step 4: Configuration
- Support for multiple environments (local, staging, production)
- Connection configuration from environment variables
- Migration path configuration

### Step 5: Testing & Documentation
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests with real SurrealDB
- Comprehensive README
- Example configurations

## ðŸš€ Ready to Start?

The test suite has proven that all technical requirements are met. We can now proceed with confidence to build the actual Nx plugin.

Would you like to:
1. Start building the plugin structure?
2. Review the implementation plan in more detail?
3. Discuss any specific requirements or features?
